# Nolus Upgrades

This folder contains sub-folders for every nolus upgrade. (Both state
migrations, and hard forks) It also defines upgrade & hard fork structs,
that each upgrade implements. These then get included in the application
app.go to run the upgrade.

## Version History


## Upgrade types

Currently in Nolus we support only one upgrade type, `Upgrade`.
If we need to support more upgrade types, like `Fork`, we can add them.
An `Upgrade` defines an upgrade that is to be acted upon by state migrations from the
SDK `x/upgrade` module.

 <!-- A `Fork` defines a hard fork that changes some
logic at a block height. If the goal is to have a new binary be
compatible with the old binary prior to the upgrade height, as is the
case for all osmosis `Fork`s, then all logic changes must be
height-gated or in the `BeginForkLogic` code. -->

```go
type Upgrade struct {
 // Upgrade version name, for the upgrade handler, e.g. `v7`
 UpgradeName string
 // Function that creates an upgrade handler
 CreateUpgradeHandler func(mm *module.Manager, configurator module.Configurator, keepers *keepers.AppKeepers) upgradetypes.UpgradeHandler
 // Store upgrades, should be used for any new modules introduced, new modules deleted, or store names renamed.
 StoreUpgrades store.StoreUpgrades
}

// type Fork struct {
//  // Upgrade version name, for the upgrade handler, e.g. `v7`
//  UpgradeName string
//  // height the upgrade occurs at
//  UpgradeHeight int64

//  // Function that runs some custom state transition code at the beginning of a fork.
//  BeginForkLogic func(ctx sdk.Context, keepers *keepers.AppKeepers)
// }
```
