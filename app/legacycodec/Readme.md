In this folder are hosted older proto generated files from ibc-go v8. We need those since we have published governance proposals in the past that used message types
from this very proto files. Those message types are not available in ibc-go v10 and our cosmos-sdk/x/gov module is not happy when you ask it to query past proposals.
We will host those cropped down proto files and register the custom(old) message types that we require just for querying proposals. Once there is a more reliable solution directly implemented in the cosmos-sdk/x/gov module (to support querying proposals of past message types that are no longer available), we can use that and delete those legacy codec files
